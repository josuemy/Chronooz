# Chronooz
When you read a news article about a topic you are not familiar with, it is hard
to understand what's going on. Chronooz is a web app that tries to help its users know more
about the context of trending news by displaying related events in chronological order. 

My friend Ricky and I worked on this Ruby on Rails project during one day of SBHacks 2017. 

###Known Bugs & Issues
The web-app displays trending news articles and their related events but there are some bugs that need to be fixed. These bugs are:

* If a news article ends in a period, or special character, the page crashes
* Sometimes, the related events page shows unrelated events --> need to define better algorithm to find keywords

##How to use Chroonoz
1. Click on the trending news article image to read that news article
2. Click on the news article header to see a list of chronological related events
