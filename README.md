# Chronooz
When you read a news article about a topic you are not familiar with, it is hard
to understand what's going on. Chronooz is a web app that tries to help its users know more
about the context of trending news by displaying related events in chronological order. 

My friend Ricky and I worked on this Ruby on Rails project during one day of SBHacks 2017. 

###Known Bugs & Issues
The web-app displays trending news articles and their related events but

* Ringtone needs to be fully implemented
* On the Card creation screens, when the user presses back, it takes the user to the Alarm list screen, instead of the Card list screen
* On the main alarm list screen, the user cannot press the back button to exit the app and go to the phone's main screen. However, they can still use the home button to do this. 


##How to use the app
